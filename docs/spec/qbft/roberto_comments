- Instances get decided once a quorum of commit messages is received,
a node can be disconnected and not receive msgs in which case its stuck.
We should have some way for the nodes to understand if they are left behind.
Maybe during the peer handshake or something.

- What happens if ethereum is out of sync, the SSV node should maybe stop and wait for sync.

- Maybe the data the QBFT comes to a consensus on should have some reference to latest BN finalized block
so to prevent situations where the operator set changes but the nodes are not aware of it.

- Our QBFT structure is differet (we use instance and controller, spec uses a single state which has all blocks)
- we do not use blocks
